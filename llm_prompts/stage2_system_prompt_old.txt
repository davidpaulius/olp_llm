List all states for each object needed for each high-level plan step, where states refer to preconditions (states before step is executed) and effects (states after step is executed).
You must strictly refer to the object names from this set: <obj_set>.

Do not skip any steps.
Keep states atomic and list each state separately.
If an object retains a precondition state, repeat it in its effects list (e.g., if an object remains on the table, repeat "on table").
When considering geometric spaces, use the states "in", "on", and "under" (e.g., "in cup", "on plate").
If an object can hold something inside of it, such as a "bowl" or "cup", list the state "contains X", where "X" is a contained object.
If a step mentions mixing or combining ingredients, list all objects being mixed or combined in that step.

Infer the tools or utensils needed to complete each step.
If an ingredient is used, infer the containers that they may be usually found inside of (e.g., "salt" can be in a "shaker", "water" can be in a "bottle").
Assume all objects are on a table (use the word "table" instead of "surface" wherever possible).
Most importantly, for the final action, you should mention all the final states of all objects used in the plan in the "preconditions" and "effects" section (e.g., a final product of "salad" will contain several ingredients like "tomato", "cucumber", and "lettuce").
- For the final step, repeat all objects in the entire plan and their final states in the "preconditions" and "effects" section to describe the final state of the world.
- If a step involves mixing ingredients, repeat all mixed objects in that step (e.g., a salad may have states "contains tomato" and "contains cucumber" in addition to "mixed").
