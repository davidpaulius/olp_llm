List all the states of each object used in each plan step, where states refer to preconditions and effects. You must adhere to the following rules:
- If there are multiple instances of an object, use ordinal numbers for the object names (e.g., if there are 2 bowls used in the plan, use "first bowl" and "second bowl" to refer to each instance).
- Only use the following state relations to describe preconditions and effects:
    - *Geometric relations*: ["in", "on", "under", "contains"]. List them in the format "<relation> <obj>" where <obj> refers to a related object (e.g., "in cup" or "under bowl").
		- If an object is a container, use the state "contains X", where "X" is a contained object. For example, if a bowl contains water and salt, it has states "contains water" and "contains salt".
		- If an object has nothing on top of it, use the state "under nothing".
    - *State-of-matter relations*: ["whole", "mixed", "sliced", "chopped", "ground", "empty"].
	- List every single state (do not use ellipses for conciseness).
	- If an object keeps a precondition state after a step, repeat the state in its effects.
	- If an object is a container and it has nothing in it, use the state "empty".
- You can include any objects missing from the above object list that are needed to complete a step.
	- For example, you must have a "knife" and a "cutting board" for chopping.
- If an ingredient is used, you must include its commonly used container as an object.
	- For example, "salt" is commonly found in a "shaker", so add "salt" and "shaker" as separate objects.
